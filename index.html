            <p>19 years ago this June, my mother and I took our first trip together to Paris. Not Paris, MO, which
                is probably a fine place where we've never been. No, we actually went on an airplane from <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Louis_Lambert_International_Airport>Lambert</a>
                when it was still as active as an international airport, and flew non-stop to the<strong> "City of Lights"</strong>. My mother had 
                never been outside of the United States at the time, and we had never traveled alone together, so of
                course, an adventure ensued.<article><a href=http://hipparis.com/2016/12/21/winter-strolls-three-itineraries-for-soaking-up-the-festive-atmosphere-giveaway>Here is an example.</a></article>
                 
            </p>
             
            <p>My mother and I arrived at Paris with relatively little trouble. We flagged a taxi, a late-model navy Mercedes-Benz sedan, and laughed about our "luxurious" ride to the city center;
                we certainly weren't in Kansas (<a class="highlight">Missouri</a>) anymore!  We arrive at our little hotel in the 6th district ("arrondissement"),
                We were grateful that we could squeeze ourselves and luggage into a miniscule elevator, but we were
                pleased with this amazing view over the rooftops of the area surrounding the Sorbonne, one of   
                the world's oldest universities.

            <p>Like a million folks before us, Mom and I loved Paris because it was beautiful. We trekked all over the city
                together, speaking my high school french, and smiling and pointing.  We ate voraciously, with the best food being 
                cafe french fries, and streetcart savory crepes.

                <p>We toured museums, of course!</p>

            <p> We midwesterners survived our Parisian odyssey, and we still yearn for <a class="highlight">french</a> fries.
