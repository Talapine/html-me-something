            <p>19 years ago this June, my mother and I took our first trip together to Paris. Not Paris, MO, which
                is probably a fine place where we've never been. NO, we actually went on an airplane from <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Louis_Lambert_International_Airport>Lambert</a>
                when it was still an international airport, and flew non-stop to the<strong> "City of Lights"</strong>. My mother had 
                never been outside of the United States at the time, and we had never traveled alone together, so of
                course an adventure ensued.<article><a href=http://hipparis.com/2016/12/21/winter-strolls-three-itineraries-for-soaking-up-the-festive-atmosphere-giveaway>Here is an example.</a></article>
            </p>
             
            <p>My mother and I arrived at the Paris with relatively little trouble. We flagged a taxi which was a litle navy Mercedes sedan. We both laughed about our "luxurious" ride;
                we certainly weren't in Kansas anymore!  We arrive at our little hotel in the 6th district ("arrondissement"),
                We were grateful that we could squeeze ourselves and luggage into a miniscule elevator, but we were
                pleased with this amazing view over the rooftops of the area surrounding the Sorbonne, one of   
                the world's oldest universities.
            </p>
            <p>Like a million folks before, I love Paris because it is beautiful. My mother and I trekked all over City
                together, speaking my high school french and smiling and pointing.  We ate all too well, with the best food being 
                cafe french fries, or streetcart crepes.
                </p>
                
                <p>We toured museums, of course!</p>
                <p>And churches</p>
                <p>And parks!</p>

            <p>We only had one public altercation on a street corner when my mother doubted my map reading skills.
                I also had my wallet stolen(completely my fault) at a Paris metro in Montmartre. All in all
                we midwesterners survived our Parisian odyssey and yearning for real french fries forevermore.
